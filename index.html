<p>Last year, I used a rudimentary Elo method to predict the probability of a tennis player reaching different stages of a grand slam tournament. While it accounted for a player's ranking, recent form, head-to-head record against opponents, previous tournament performance and court surface, it did not carry much probabilistic Bayesian elements, which caused some of the predictions to be somewhat inaccurate.</p>

<p>This project seeks to expand the scope of last year's project by making odd predictions <strong>by point</strong>, not just by match. It also seeks to take a more Bayesian approach, where there is an underlying point-by-point odds model that dictates the prior distribution, which is then updated with player-specific and match-specific information (i.e. recent form, head-to-head, court surface) to make a final prediction.</p>

<p>See below for the latest point-by-point update on the ATP World Tour. For an in-depth methodology, check out my post on my blog DataBucket.</p>
